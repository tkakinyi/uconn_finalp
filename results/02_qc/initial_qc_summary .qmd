## Data Description and initial QC

97 raw reads of paired Illumina files from waste water samples from all 13 geo-locations were downloaded from NCBI under BioProject PRJNA765031. The preprocessing included running through fastqc v0.12.1 and multiqc v1.15. Trimming for adapter content using trimmomatic v0.39 using the TruSeq3-PE-2 adapter content file. This initial fastqc report @tbl-one showed low numbers of sequence counts, with highest sample having 0.6M reads and about 30 samples rounding to 0M reads, a wide range of duplication (0.0% - 97.9%) duplication and a median %GC of 30.5. The median read length is 151bp.

## Trimming results

The low read count a bit concerning but maybe characteristic of environmental sampling where the content is not viral rna cannot be guaranteed to have sufficient concentrations. The authors do report that of the 13 sampling locations most of the samples used were obtained from 5 sites, that is only 56 samples were utilized for the mutational analysis.

After adapter trimming, there are samples that failed to trim some adapter content with three samples reporting above 20% adapter content (figure 1) @fig-trims, therefore a rerun of trimmomatic v0.39 was performed on the raw reads using the adapater content file NexteraPE-PE file instead. This is because majority of the failed files showed nextera transposase sequence as failing to successfully trim, as well as high (80%) polya content across all positions for example on Sample SRR16004567 @fig-trims2 . Since the polya contamination is on minority of samples, these samples are marked for caution as downstream analysis is implemented. Things to watch out for in downstream analysis include whether these samples 1) reported read count rounded to 0; 2)the location of the collection was included in the original paper mutational analysis; 3) the identified reads for these sample according to[NCBI run browser on the samples for project PRJNA765031](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRP338175&o=acc_s%3Aa) e.g sample SRR16004567 identified reads are 3% compared to other samples that are above 90% e.g. sample SRR16004558 with 97.8% identified as viral and 89.19% coronavirus.

![Figure 1: Sample SRR16004579 with nextera_transposas_sequence adapater content peaking at 41% on base 140](images/fig1.PNG)

Samples were identified as having high (\>20%) adapter content for more than half the bases. This were run using Trimmomatic v0.39 trimming with TruSeq3-PE-2 adapter content file. All the samples above 20% showed polya adpater content.

:::

The fastqc results of the running trimmonatic with the adpater file changed to NexteraPE-PE, show that most samples have below 20% adapater content which is acceptable for further analysis.

::: {#fig-trims2 layout-ncol=1}

![](images/fig2.PNG){#fig2}

8 samples, remains with consistent 80% polya contamination after changing the adapter library to NexteraPE-PE. This sample will not be included in the mutational analysis for reasons explained above. All other remaining sample report adapter content below 15%.
